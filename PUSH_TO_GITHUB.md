# 🚀 Push to GitHub Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `advanced-text2sql`
   - **Description**: `Advanced Text2SQL system that outperforms Arctic-Text2SQL-R1 using policy solvers, schema disambiguators, and multi-agent RL`
   - **Visibility**: Public (recommended for sharing)
   - **DON'T** initialize with README (we already have files)

## Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory (if not already there)
cd /Users/akhouriabhinavaditya/advanced-text2sql-project

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/advanced-text2sql.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload

Check that all files are uploaded:
- [ ] README.md displays properly
- [ ] All Python files are present
- [ ] requirements.txt is included
- [ ] LICENSE file is visible
- [ ] .gitignore is working (no unwanted files)

## Step 4: Configure Repository Settings

### Topics/Tags
Add these topics to help people find your repository:
- `text2sql`
- `natural-language-processing`
- `machine-learning`
- `transformers`
- `reinforcement-learning`
- `database-query`
- `policy-optimization`
- `schema-understanding`

### Repository Description
```
Advanced Text2SQL system that outperforms Arctic-Text2SQL-R1 using policy solvers, schema disambiguators, and multi-agent reinforcement learning
```

### Website (optional)
If you create a demo or documentation site, add it here.

## Step 5: Create Releases

After pushing, create your first release:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Releases" → "Create a new release"
3. Tag: `v1.0.0`
4. Title: `🚀 Advanced Text2SQL v1.0.0 - Outperform Arctic-Text2SQL-R1`
5. Description:
```markdown
# 🎯 Advanced Text2SQL System v1.0.0

```

## Step 6: Additional Setup (Optional)

### Enable GitHub Actions (for CI/CD)
Create `.github/workflows/` directory for automated testing and deployment.

### Add Branch Protection Rules
Protect your main branch:
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date

### Create Issues Templates
Help contributors submit better issues and feature requests.

### Set up GitHub Pages
Create documentation website from your README and docs.
